# Ebb and Flow
## View project here----> [https://github.com/stefoncarpino/summary/blob/master/README.md]

In this lesson, we were introduced to the "ebb and flow" of web design. Here, we were taught to think about the contnet first, and then focus on the execution. We read "A Dao of Web Design". An article by John Allsopp. In the article, Allsopp talks about how web design will be the new platform for professional artists and designers.

# Web Safe Fonts
## View project here----> [https://stefoncarpino.github.io/type-specimen/]

In this project, we learned about web safe fonts. Web safe fonts are fonts that are pre-installed by many operating systems. We had to choose a font and research the font itself and the creator/designer of the font. The font that I chose was Courier whic was designed by Howard "Buzz" Kettler.

# Single Serving Sites
## View Project Here---> [https://stefoncarpino.github.io/key-card/]

This was our final project, here we had to view examples of a single-serving web page. Then we had to create one. This website could be about anything that we wanted it to be about. I decided to teach something in my website. Since I am a magician I had decided to teach people how to do one of the most basic card techniques in magic. The key card principle.
